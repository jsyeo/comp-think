# Interactive Programs

In this lesson we are going to design interactive programs. Here's a
demo of what we will be building:

It will be a program that is animated and it responses to our key or
mouse inputs.

First off, before we start building, we need to talk about what an
interactive program or interactive world is. Let's look at this
example of a landing rocket. What's happening behind the scenes is
that there's three things causing things to change in the world.
